Dear Hiring Manager/Team,
I am excited to express my strong interest in the Senior QA Analyst position at Nutrafol. With over 10 years of experience in software quality assurance, in HIPAA-compliant healthcare, Banking, financial and eCommerce environments, I bring a deep commitment to detail, end-user quality, and collaborative delivery of web and mobile products.
Nutrafol’s search for a QA Analyst who combines technical expertise, critical thinking, and relentless attention to detail truly aligns with my values. At WebPT, I led QA testing for EMR and scheduling workflows across web and iPad apps, validating REST APIs, managing test plans and releases in Agile sprints, and mentoring offshore teams. My experience spans manual functional, regression, and UI testing, along with backend SQL validation, cross-browser/device coverage, and usability feedback. I have recently expanded my skills with focused training in mobile testing and the integration of AI tools in QA workflows.
I understand that having a recent employment gap may cause hesitation, I kindly request you please consider my experience, dedication, and strong work ethic I bring to this role. I have spent the last several months volunteering, upskilling, and continuing to grow, because I deeply care about doing meaningful work and staying sharp. If given the opportunity, I am confident my performance will reflect my strong work ethic, problem-solving ability, and dedication to team success.
I would be happy to provide references from previous roles who can speak to how I work, how I show up for the team, and how I consistently strive to deliver value. I truly believe that all it takes is someone willing to give me a chance, and I hope Nutrafol will be that place.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be honored to contribute to Nutrafol’s mission and continue growing together.
Thanks & regards,
Fatima
